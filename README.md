jspacman DOM/CSS/HTML/AJAX
==========================

This was my first try to write javascript pacman back in 2007 (when nobody care about js). The game still works and you can play it here:

Certaily, I wrote the code in a rush and there are lots of things I could have been done better. Today (2013) writing a game like this is so much easier and you can use a javascript game engine and your life will be so much easier.

A few weeks ago I decided to rewrite the pacman but this time using ImpactJS (http://impactjs.com/). I will release the code soon. In the meantime you can play it here:
